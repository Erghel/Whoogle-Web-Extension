# Whoogle Web Extension
We took the source code of <a href="https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search">Whoogle</a> and placed it on the <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> server. The code was not changed, no additional settings were made. 

**Whoogle** - a self-hosted, ad-free, privacy-respecting metasearch engine.
