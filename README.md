# Whoogle Web Extension
We took the source code of [**Whoogle**](https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search) and placed it on the <a href="https://replit.com/"><b>Replit</b></a> server. The code was not changed, no additional settings were made. The "repl" is located at [**this link**](https://replit.com/@SerBanBanan/whoogle-search).
