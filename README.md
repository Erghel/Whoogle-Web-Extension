# Whoogle Web Extension
We took the source code of <a href="https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search"><b>Whoogle</b></a> and placed it on the <a href="https://replit.com/"><b>Replit</b></a> server. The code was not changed, no additional settings were made. 

**Whoogle** - a self-hosted, ad-free, privacy-respecting metasearch engine.

# Tricks
If you want use **Whoogle** as support to main search engine do this:
- add this addon into your browser 
- agree when browser shows you "Add this extension?"
- disagree when browser shows "Do you want change your main search engine?" 
- use keywords like ```@woogle, @wg, @who"``` if you want use **Whoogle** when you make request
